# Vervet
Vervet is a simple CLI tool for performing common Vault unseal key operations using the YubiKey OpenPGP application. Vervet streamlines common Vault unseal key workflows into single commands for ease of use. Yubico YubiKeys ensure that private keys used to decrypt Vault unseal keys are stored in hardware and non-exportable.
